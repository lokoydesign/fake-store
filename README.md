# FakeStore (Work in progress)

Fake store is a [React](https://reactjs.org/) assignment project I've made for the Kodehode course at Jobloop.<br/>
It includes the use of various React technologies such at [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/), [react-redux](https://react-redux.js.org/), [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/) and more.
